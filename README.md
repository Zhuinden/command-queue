# Command Queue

The command queue lets you register a single receiver, and while there is no receiver, the commands are enqueued.

## Using Command Queue

In order to use Command Queue, you need to add jitpack to your project root gradle:

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            // ...
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
        // ...
    }
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            // ...
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
        // ...
    }


and add the compile dependency to your module level gradle.

    compile 'com.github.Zhuinden:command-queue:1.0.0'
